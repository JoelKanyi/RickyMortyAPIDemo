# Ricky&MortyAPIDemo

A simple app that consumes The Rick and Morty API which is a REST and GraphQL API based on the television show Rick and Morty. I was trying to learn about pagination with the paging 3 library, built with clean architecture principles and jetpack libraries.

Min Api Level : 16 

## Setup Requirements

- Android device or emulator
- Android Studio

## Getting Started

In order to get the app running yourself, you need to:

1.  clone this project
2.  Import the project into Android Studio
3.  Connect the android device with USB or just use your emulator
4.  In Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

## Libraries

Libraries used in the whole application are:

- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin
- [Viewmodel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) -The ViewModel class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way
- [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) -  A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - A concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
- [Paging 3 library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview) -  The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently.
- [Retofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit) -  Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
- [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) -  A dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project
- [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) -  Helps you implement navigation, from simple button clicks to more complex patterns, such as app bars and the navigation drawer.
- [Logging Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) -  logs HTTP request and response data.
- [Material Libarary](https://material.io/develop/android) -  Modular and customizable Material Design UI components for Android
